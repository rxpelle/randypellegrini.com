excerpt: "A 53-page agreement. Binding on heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns. The silence was heritable. Every clause shaped like what it was hiding. This isn't fiction — it's how institutional secrecy actually works, and why the truth doesn't set you free. It just becomes someone else's problem."
