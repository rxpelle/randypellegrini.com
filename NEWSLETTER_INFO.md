# Newsletter Setup Information

## ConvertKit Account

## Where to Find Subscribers

New subscribers will appear in **two places** depending on whether they've confirmed their email:

### 1. Unconfirmed Subscribers
**Link:** https://app.convertkit.com/subscribers/unconfirmed

New signups appear here FIRST. They stay here until they click the confirmation link in their email.

After clicking the confirmation email, subscribers move here and can receive your newsletters.
